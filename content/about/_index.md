Hey! I'm Meghan. I am a software developer & I study problems that fall under the realm of computational science. The earlier stage of my career was focused on tool building, mostly on learning how to become an effective software developer across various areas of the stack. Some of my old work is featured here (will update with more current work soon). Back in the day, I studied Computer Science & Math @ MIT


## 🌈 Time is short. A story of my curiosity's recent evolution

2017/2018 was a whirlwind of intellectual adventures & building a beautiful new life in Germany.

In this time, I met some **seriously interesting & brilliant people** who patiently introduced me to new topics, kindly embraced my curiosity and somewhat naivete (thank you! 💜), & extended offers of collaboration. This led to exciting opportunities like teaching a [Udacity course on ML for iOS](https://www.udacity.com/course/core-ml--ud1038) ... to building software across areas of the stack I'd previously thought out of reach to me ... to being invited to speak or give workshops in a dozen or so countries & being a [guest on podcasts with people I once seemed like distant superheros](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/podcast/22) ... to having the incredible opportunity to contribute (albeit modestly) to the high energy physics community's Scientific Software Institute (CERN, Fermilab, etc) culminating in a paper [A Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06982)

### 🤓 Back to my roots

Exposure to many people & fields opened pandora's box in a way, but it also had a side effect of bringing me back to my roots. I started reviewing foundational topics that underlied many of these problems, in math, philosophy, & physics. I spent every spare moment in the library. Slowly, with time, the dots kept connecting, and this is probably just the beginning. 

I had lots of nostalgia as these activities reminded me of my bright-eyed 16 year old self who happily spent nights with Art of Problem Solving books or Feynmann lectures and spent summers doing math & science "research". If 16 year old me could see a decade into the future, she may be anxiously wondering, "What happened!?" A decade later, how did I get so far away from my original intentions & intellectual true loves?

### 🔮 The future is unwritten

Time is short. It's 2019 and I am excited to put the pieces together and find a way to dedicate the rest of my life to working on applied science problems.

Given my past deeper studies in mathematics & computer science and an undergraduate level background in the natural sciences (physics, chemistry, & biology), I'm currently exploring one application area every few months to surface the problems I think (1) I could contribute to maximally, (2) are tractable to solve, (3) are under-resourced and therefore may be ripe for rapid progress. This entails studying (formally+informally), understanding the current state, reproducing research, learning new tools, meeting with experts, & writing up my learnings. From drug discovery to climate modeling, lets see where this goes.

Hopefully, the later part of 2019 will involve moving full speed ahead toward a narrower set of problems. The future is still unwritten. 

### 🚀 Let's collaborate

If you would like to discuss ideas, are interested in collaborating, or just want to chat, please feel free to reach out.

And if you actually read this far, thank you very much for spending your precious time crossing paths with me.
