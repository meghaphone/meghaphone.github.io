### 🌈 Time is short. A story of my curiosity's recent evolution

2017 & 2018 brought a whirlwind of intellectual adventures & launched the beginning of a beautiful new life chapter in Germany.

In this time, I met some **seriously interesting & brilliant people** who patiently introduced me to new topics, kindly embraced my curiosity and somewhat naivete (thank you! 💜), and extended offers of collaboration. This led to exciting opportunities much more varied than 2016 Brooklyn-dwelling Meghan expected. 

Some highlights include teaching a [Udacity course on ML for iOS](https://www.udacity.com/course/core-ml--ud1038) ... to building software across areas of the stack I'd previously thought out of reach to me ... to regularly reading research papers and gradually growing from a passive fly-on-the-wall to an active & engaged participant ... to being invited to speak or give workshops in a dozen or so countries & being a [guest on podcasts with people I once seemed like distant superheros](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/podcast/22) ... to having the incredible opportunity to contribute (albeit modestly) to the high energy physics community's Scientific Software Institute (an industry collaboration with CERN, Fermilab, etc). This culminated in a paper [A Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06982).

### 🤓 Back to my roots

Exposure to many people & fields opened pandora's box in a way, but it also had a side effect of bringing me back to my roots. I started reviewing foundational topics that underlied many of these problems, in math, philosophy, & physics. I spent every spare moment in the library aka the OG coworking spaces. Slowly, with time, the dots kept connecting, and this is probably just the beginning. 

I had lots of nostalgia as these activities reminded me of my bright-eyed 16 year old self who happily spent nights with Art of Problem Solving books for math olympiad or Feynman lectures and [spent summers doing math & science "research"](https://depts.drew.edu/govschl/NJGSS2006/Journal/TeamPages/Team6JournalPage.htm) 🤣 #tbt. If 16 year old me could see a decade into the future, she may be anxiously wondering, "What happened!?" A decade later, how did I get so far away from my original intentions & intellectual true loves?

### 🔮 The future is unwritten

Time is short. It's 2019 and I am excited to put the pieces together and find a way to dedicate the rest of my life to working on applied science problems.

Given my past deeper studies in mathematics & computer science and an undergraduate level foundational understanding of the natural sciences (physics, chemistry, & biology), I'm currently exploring one application area every few months to surface the problems I think (1) I have the highest probability of contributing effectively in a reasonable timeframe, (2) are tractable to solve, (3) are under-resourced and therefore may be ripe for rapid progress. Side note: this approach roughly borrows from some ideas from the [Effective Altruism movement's 80000 hours organization](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/), which I highly recommend as a resource. 

This rapid but focused exploration period entails studying (formally+informally), understanding the current state, reproducing research, learning new tools, meeting with experts, & writing up my learnings. From drug discovery to climate modeling, lets see where this goes.

Hopefully, the later part of 2019 will involve moving full speed ahead toward a narrower set of problems. The future is still unwritten.
