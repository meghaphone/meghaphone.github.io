    "Hey! I'm Meghan. I am a software developer & I study problems that fall under the realm of computational science. The earlier stage of my career was focused on tool building, mostly on learning how to become an effective software developer across various areas of the stack. Next step is to use these tools to contribute to problems in the realm of applied science, no matter how much learning that takes to do. Some of my old work is featured here (will update with more current work, studies, & researchÂ efforts soon). Back in the day, I studied Computer Science & Math @ MIT"
